# 🛡️ Guardian Ad Blocker: A Journey from Frustration to Innovation

## 🌟 What Inspired Me

My journey with the Guardian Ad Blocker began from a place of genuine frustration. As an avid internet user, I found myself increasingly annoyed by the aggressive advertising landscape that had taken over the web. Every website visit was becoming a battle against:

- **Intrusive pop-ups** that seemed to multiply faster than I could close them
- **YouTube ads** that interrupted my viewing experience every few minutes
- **Tracking scripts** that followed my browsing habits without consent
- **Sponsored content** that was becoming indistinguishable from real content
- **Auto-playing video ads** that startled me and wasted bandwidth

The final straw came when I was trying to watch a tutorial on YouTube, and the video was interrupted by 3 consecutive unskippable ads. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands and build something that would give users back control of their browsing experience.

I was inspired by the philosophy of **uBlock Origin** - the idea that users should have the power to choose what content they consume online. However, I wanted to create something that was not just effective, but also modern, user-friendly, and built with the latest web technologies.

## 🏗️ How I Built It

The Guardian Ad Blocker was built using a **layered architecture** approach, with each layer providing different levels of protection:

### **Layer 1: Network-Level Blocking (DNR Rules)**
```javascript
// Comprehensive network rules in rules.json
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": { "type": "block" },
  "condition": {
    "urlFilter": "||youtube.com/get_video_ads?*",
    "resourceTypes": ["xmlhttprequest"]
  }
}
```

I started with the foundation - blocking ads at the network level before they even reach the page. This involved:
- Creating 100+ declarative net request rules
- Targeting specific ad networks and domains
- Blocking YouTube ad requests specifically
- Implementing domain-specific blocking strategies

### **Layer 2: DOM-Level Blocking (Content Scripts)**
```javascript
// Intelligent element detection and removal
const blockElementWithAI = async (element) => {
    if (!element || !element.parentNode) return;
    
    // Traditional detection first
    const traditionalBlock = isTraditionalAdElement(element);
    if (traditionalBlock) {
        element.remove();
        updateStats('banner', window.location.hostname);
        return;
    }
    
    // AI-powered detection as backup
    const aiBlock = await detectAdWithAI(element);
    if (aiBlock) {
        element.remove();
        updateStats('other', window.location.hostname);
    }
};
```

The content script became the heart of the system, implementing:
- **Traditional ad detection** using CSS selectors and pattern matching
- **AI-powered detection** using OpenRouter API for complex cases
- **Site-specific optimizations** for YouTube, news sites, and streaming platforms
- **Essential element protection** to avoid blocking legitimate content

### **Layer 3: Dynamic Cleanup (MutationObserver)**
```javascript
// Real-time DOM monitoring
const observer = new MutationObserver(async (mutations) => {
    mutations.forEach(async (mutation) => {
        if (mutation.type === 'childList') {
            mutation.addedNodes.forEach(async (node) => {
                if (node.nodeType === Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {
                    await blockElementWithAI(node);
                }
            });
        }
    });
});
```

I implemented a sophisticated mutation observer system that:
- **Monitors DOM changes** in real-time
- **Automatically blocks** newly injected ads
- **Optimizes performance** with intelligent throttling
- **Preserves page functionality** while removing ads

### **Layer 4: User Interface (React + TypeScript)**
```typescript
// Modern, responsive popup interface
interface AdStats {
    totalBlocked: number;
    blockedByType: {
        banner: number;
        video: number;
        popup: number;
        redirect: number;
        other: number;
    };
    blockedByDomain: Record<string, number>;
}
```

The popup interface was built with:
- **React 19** for modern component architecture
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for beautiful, responsive design
- **Real-time statistics** showing blocking effectiveness

### **Layer 5: AI-Powered Detection**
```javascript
// AI integration for complex ad detection
const detectAdWithAI = async (element) => {
    const elementInfo = {
        tagName: element.tagName,
        className: element.className,
        id: element.id,
        src: element.src || '',
        href: element.href || '',
        textContent: element.textContent?.substring(0, 200) || '',
        attributes: Array.from(element.attributes).map(attr => `${attr.name}="${attr.value}"`).join(' ')
    };
    
    const response = await fetch(OPENROUTER_API_URL, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            model: 'anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet',
            messages: [
                {
                    role: 'system',
                    content: 'You are an expert ad detection system.'
                },
                {
                    role: 'user',
                    content: `Analyze this HTML element and determine if it's an advertisement. Respond with only "AD" if it's an ad, or "CLEAN" if it's legitimate content.`
                }
            ]
        })
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.choices?.[0]?.message?.content?.includes('AD');
};
```
